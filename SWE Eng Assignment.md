# 🧪 Splash.tech Take-Home Assignment: Prediction Service

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in Splash.tech! This short take-home assignment is designed to help us understand how you reason through problems, structure code, and make decisions — not just whether you can code a REST API.

We value your time and want this to reflect how you might actually work in a product team. But please don't spend days on this. It's ok to use AI for scaffolding or as a google assist tool, but please don't vibe code or ask the AI to generate everything for you.

## 🎯 Context

At Splash, we run weekly sports prediction games. Every Sunday, users log in to predict match outcomes. On Monday, the results go live.

We want to build a small service to manage predictions.

---

## 🛠️ Task

Build a simple backend API (Java, Spring Boot preferred) to support the following:

### ✏️ Features

1. **Create a prediction**  
   Input: `userId`, `matchId`, `predictedWinner`

2. **View predictions by user**  
   Return all predictions for a given user

3. **Update a prediction**  
   Only allowed **if the prediction is still open** (e.g., match hasn’t started)

---

### 🧠 Requirements

- Use **Java** (Spring Boot preferred)
- Add **any assumption or improvement** you think is necessary  
  (e.g., match close time, validation, multi-sport support)
- Write clean, readable code — but don’t worry about production polish

---
 
### 📄 What to include

1.  A Design, we like escalidraw +, but feel free to use draw io, or even paper.
2.  **Your code**, ideally in a Git repo or a zip/tar file
3. A short **README** with:
   - Assumptions or design decisions you made
   - Tradeoffs or things you'd improve with more time
   - How to run your app (locally or via Docker)

---

### 💡 Bonus (optional)

These are not required, but show off bonus skills if you’d like:

- Add a **Dockerfile** or `docker-compose.yml`
- Add **basic tests** or a test runner command
- Add a **GitHub Actions workflow** or other CI config
- Add **logging** for prediction actions

---

## 🧪 What We’re Looking For

- Thoughtful, **well-reasoned decisions**
- Clean structure and **ownership over the full lifecycle**
---

📬 When you're ready, send your submission or GitHub link to:  
**jack@splash.tech**

We're excited to see your work!
